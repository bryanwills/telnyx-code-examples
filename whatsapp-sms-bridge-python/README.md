# WhatsApp-SMS Bridge

## What Does This Example Do?

Bidirectional message bridge between WhatsApp and SMS. Messages from one channel get forwarded to the other, with sender attribution.

## Who Is This For?

- Developers building with Telnyx APIs.
- Teams looking for production-ready starting points.
- Anyone exploring what's possible with communications infrastructure + AI.

## Why Telnyx?

Telnyx is an **AI Communications Infrastructure** platform. This example runs entirely on Telnyx -- no third-party APIs, no middleware, no glue code between vendors.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Telnyx account with API key from [portal.telnyx.com](https://portal.telnyx.com)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for local development
