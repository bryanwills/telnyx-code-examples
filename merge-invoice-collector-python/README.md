# Merge Invoice Collector

> Also known as: accounts receivable, invoice collection, payment reminders, AR automation.

Pulls overdue invoices from accounting via Merge sorted by amount. AI calls debtors in priority order, negotiates payment terms conversationally, and sends SMS payment links mid-call.
